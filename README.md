## 🚀 Features

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization).  
- Feature extraction (Bag of Words, TF-IDF, word embeddings).  
- Sentiment analysis and text classification.  
- Explorations of transformer-based models (e.g., BERT).  
- Visualization of results and performance metrics.
